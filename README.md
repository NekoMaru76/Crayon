# Crayon
An interpreted programming language written in Go for idiots.

# What the Fuck?
There are only tags, commands (statements), values, variables and scope. Well, for now.

# What the Fuck is a Tag?
It works like a function, but you can't directly call it, only system can, at least for now.
## Kinds of Tag
1. MAIN
```
[MAIN]
```
It will execute when the engine ready.
2. FRAME
```
[FRAME XX]
```
It will execute after XX seconds.
3. LOOP
```
[LOOP]
```
It will execute every time until you kill it.

# Commands
```
